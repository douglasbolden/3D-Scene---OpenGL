    <li>How do I approach designing software?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</li>
        <p>I actually learned how to use Blender pretty decently. I learned to work with Vertex Array Objects and Vertex Buffer Objects to generate graphical representations based on the different coordinates, transformations, and difficulties.</p>
        <li>What design process did you follow for your project work?</li>
        <p>The best design choices, of course! On a real note. I took pictures of a scene, and I recreated the scene in a 3D rendered environment.</p>
        <li>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</li>
        <p>After many years of debugging and design, it is logical to assume that the majority of code manipulation will make its return during another class, and/or when I get a job in my field.</p>
      </ul>
    <li>How do I approach developing programs?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</li>
        <p>I had never orogrammed in a 3D space before. This meant that I had to understand VAOs, VBOs, and assorted libraries (glm, GLEW. GLFW, stb, Glad, etc.) in order to understand the material efficiently.</p>
        <li>How did iteration factor into your development?</li>
        <p>I probably ran this program over a thousand times. This is because as you are learning in 3D space, you are extremely prone to bugs and errors.</p>
        <li>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</li>
        <p>I learned how to efficiently manipulate a 3D scene. I learned that it is better to understand the bigger picture than it is the smaller one, but the smaller picture can be easier to program! I started out with no knowledge of this at all, and realized that it isn't too hard to understand, but it is extremely complex!</p>
      </ul>
    <li>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</li>
        <p>This gives me insight on some things that I will need to know in order to be successful at a professional capacity. </p>
        <li>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</li>
        <p>This gives me new information that I can store that I can use to show that I have proficiency and working-knowledge of material that the employer may need.</p>
      </ul>
